# JavaScript 

## Fundamentals

### Variables

In JavaScript, we use  let keyword to declare variables. 



If you use a variable without initializing it, it will have an undefined value.

```javascript
let x; // x is the name of the variable

console.log(x); // undefined
```





### Constants

The const keyword was also introduced in the ES6(ES2015) version to create constants. 

Once a constant is initialized, we cannot change its value.

```javascript
const x = 5;
x = 10;  // Error! constant cannot be changed.
console.log(x)
```

Simply, a constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed.

Also, you cannot declare a constant without initializing it.

```javascript
const x;  // Error! Missing initializer in const declaration.
x = 5;
console.log(x)
```





### Data Types

There are eight basic data types in JavaScript. They are:

| Data Types  | Description                                        | Example                           |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `String`    | represents textual data                            | `'hello'`, `"hello world!"` etc   |
| `Number`    | an integer or a floating-point number              | `3`, `3.234`, `3e-2` etc.         |
| `BigInt`    | an integer with arbitrary precision                | `900719925124740999n` , `1n` etc. |
| `Boolean`   | Any of two values: true or false                   | `true` and `false`                |
| `undefined` | a data type whose variable is not initialized      | `let a;`                          |
| `null`      | denotes a `null` value                             | `let a = null;`                   |
| `Symbol`    | data type whose instances are unique and immutable | `let value = Symbol('hello');`    |
| `Object`    | key-value pairs of collection of data              | `let student = { };`              |

Here, all data types except Object are primitive data types, whereas Object is non-primitive.



(1) String

```javascript
//strings example
const name = 'ram';
const name1 = "hari";
const result = `The names are ${name} and ${name1}`;
```

Single quotes and double quotes are practically the same and you can use either of them.

Backticks are generally used when you need to include variables or expressions into a string. This is done by wrapping variables or expressions with ${variable or expression} as shown above.



(2) Number

```javascript
const number1 = 3;
const number2 = 3.433;
const number3 = 3e5 // 3 * 10^5
```

A number type can also be +Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN (not a number). 

```javascript
const number1 = 3/0;
console.log(number1); // Infinity

const number2 = -3/0;
console.log(number2); // -Infinity

// strings can't be divided by numbers
const number3 = "abc"/3; 
console.log(number3);  // NaN
```



(3) BigInt

In JavaScript, Number type can only represent numbers less than (253 - 1) and more than -(253 - 1). However, if you need to use a larger number than that, you can use the BigInt data type.

A BigInt number is created by appending n to the end of an integer. 

```javascript
// BigInt value
const value1 = 900719925124740998n;

// Adding two big integers
const result1 = value1 + 1n;
console.log(result1); // "900719925124740999n"

const value2 = 900719925124740998n;

// Error! BitInt and number cannot be added
const result2 = value2 + 1; 
console.log(result2); 
```



(4) Boolean

```javascript
const dataChecked = true;
const valueCounted = false;
```



(5) undefined

The undefined data type represents value that is not assigned. If a variable is declared but the value is not assigned, then the value of that variable will be undefined.

```javascript
let name;
console.log(name); // undefined
```



(6) null

In JavaScript, null is a special value that represents empty or unknown value. 

```javascript
const number = null;
```



(7) Symbol

This data type was introduced in a newer version of JavaScript (from ES2015).

A value having the data type Symbol can be referred to as a symbol value. Symbol is an immutable primitive value that is unique. 

```javascript
// two symbols with the same description

const value1 = Symbol('hello');
const value2 = Symbol('hello');
```

Though value1 and value2 both contain 'hello', they are different as they are of the Symbol type.



(8) Object

An object is a complex data type that allows us to store collections of data.

```javascript
const student = {
    firstName: 'ram',
    lastName: null,
    class: 10
};
```
