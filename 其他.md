# Economics 

## Economic Principles

(1) People face trade-offs

Everyone faces decisions that put one option above the other. Most decisions, especially economic ones, involve trading off one thing for another.

In society, one of the main trade-offs we experience is between efficiency and equity. Efficiency refers to something we can get the most out of, especially if the resource is scarce. Equity implies that all members of society benefit equally from a resource. The theory is that people will make good decisions if they thoroughly understand both options.

However, what usually ends up happening in life and in economics is that one item, either efficiency or equity, is chosen above the other. For example, the way students decide to spend their time or how governments allocate budgets can be examples of the trade-offs people face.



(2) The cost of something is what you give up to get it

Since people face these trade-offs, a decision requires a comparison of the costs against the benefits of alternative courses of action. Sometimes, the most obvious action or answer isn’t the first one you would think of.

Each item has an opportunity cost, in other words, what you’re giving up to get it. So, when facing a decision, people should understand the opportunity cost involved in that decision and in each action.

For example, some people consider only the cost of an action, but not the time involved. Cooking dinner at home is cheaper than ordering from a restaurant, but takes up a lot more time than calling to place an order.



(3) Rational people think at the margin

In general, economists like to assume that people are rational thinkers. Still, they look at marginal changes to describe small adjustments to the plan of action. Another way of looking at this is that people make decisions when they think at the margin, or around the edge of a plan of action.

For example, the decision of whether or not to take an extra class in your semester is an incremental decision that will have you comparing marginal costs and benefits. 

When considering marginal changes, we as consumers are looking for the maximum satisfaction on our purchases that fit with our budgets and incomes. So, we look for ways to achieve maximum satisfaction within the constraints of what we are willing to pay for a commodity, and the decisions it takes to get there are influenced by marginal changes and rational thinking.



(4) People respond to incentives

This economic principle isn’t surprising but makes a lot of sense when we consider the last few principles. Since consumers make decisions by comparing benefits and cost, what happens when that scale changes? That’s where incentives play a part.

Incentives inspire consumers to act by offering up an extra reward to those people who will change their behavior. Incentives can also be positive or negative, meaning you can incentivize people to do something or not to do something.

For example, a positive incentive would be offering employees a bonus if they work extra hours. However, a negative incentive can be exemplified by extra taxes governments might put on things like fuel that encourage people to use it less.



(5) Trade can make everyone better off

This one seems obvious, but trade can be a positive for all parties involved. It’s not like a competition where one side wins and the other loses. In trade, all parties can win by focusing on what they’re best at.

The best example of this is countries that benefit from trading with each other. Most countries don’t have all the resources they need to function effectively, so they turn to other countries for more or even cheaper resources that they can trade. It also allows for a wider variety of goods to become available in the country, which increases competition on a global scale.



(6) Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity

A lot of countries used to have a centrally planned economy but are now moving towards market economies.

In a market economy, decisions are made collectively by millions of households and firms that have a stake in the economy. If you think about it, it’s like a cycle. Households decide where they’ll work, and firms decide who they want to hire and what to produce. These two parties interact in the market economy where decisions are guided by self-interest.

Sometimes, the market economy or aspects of it fail, and that’s where governments have to step in to implement policy. But usually, the interaction between households and firms are guided almost automatically, seemingly by an ‘invisible hand’ that helps direct economic activity.

The result is that households and firms consider prices when looking at what to buy and sell, and they both look at costs and social benefits, which ultimately ends in a society’s welfare being increased.



(7) Government can sometimes improve market outcomes

We touched on the government interfering in the market in the last economic principle in the form of policy creation, but why does the government need to intervene when we have the invisible hand?

Well, the hand actually relies on the government for protection. The market will only work if certain rights are enforced, and the hand needs help in organizing economic activity within the market, namely, to promote both efficiency and equity.

Markets can fail when they fail to allocate resources efficiently, and this happens as a result of externality, which is when an action produces an impact on the well-being of a bystander, or in this case, of society. An example of this is pollution and the well-being of the environment. Without the intervention of governments, the market could have a negative impact without even meaning to. 

Additionally, the invisible hand might not focus on how to distribute resources equitably and instead may reward individuals based on their production.



(8) A country’s standard of living depends on country production

As we know, there are different standards of living in different countries, and this is directly correlated to the country’s productivity.

Not only that, but the changes over time of standards of living can also be quite significant. For example, even in high-income countries, the Western world has made leaps and bounds in what we consider to be the standard of living. When compared to lower-income countries, the growth of the standard of living is slower.

This growth can be traced back to the goods and services produced in each country. In places where workers are able to produce more goods, the standard of living is higher, and vice versa. To increase the living standard, there need to be public policies that affect it without negatively impacting productivity by way of increasing education and providing better access to tools and technology.



(9) Prices rise when the government prints too much money

This one is relatively simple. Prices follow inflation, and a high rate of inflation increases costs, so economic policymakers aim for a lower level of inflation to keep the market moving. In most cases of a high rate of inflation, the cause is that there’s too much money in circulation. When governments print more money and there’s more available, its value decreases.



(10) Society faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment

Another result that occurs when there’s more money circulating is a lower rate of employment. Economists use the Phillips Curve to trace the correlation between the two, which helps them understand market and business cycles. The Phillips Curve aims to push inflation and unemployment in opposite directions.

Policymakers can impact inflation and unemployment by altering how much money is printed, as well as the amount of government taxes. Therefore, the policies that are implemented by governments and policymakers have a direct impact on the market and economy and can severely impact the rates of inflation and unemployment.



## Supply and Demand

supply and demand, in economics, relationship between the quantity of a commodity that producers wish to sell at various prices and the quantity that consumers wish to buy. It is the main model of price determination used in economic theory. The price of a commodity is determined by the interaction of supply and demand in a market.





## Inflation

Inflation is a measure of the rate of rising prices of goods and services in an economy. If inflation is occurring, leading to higher prices for basic necessities such as food, it can have a negative impact on society.

Inflation can be a concern because it makes money saved today less valuable tomorrow. Inflation erodes a consumer's purchasing power and can even interfere with the ability to retire. 

There are various factors that can drive prices or inflation in an economy. Typically, inflation results from an increase in production costs or an increase in demand for products and services.

While consumers experience little benefit from inflation, investors can enjoy a boost if they hold assets in markets affected by inflation. For example, those who are invested in energy companies might see a rise in their stock prices if energy prices are rising.





## Bubble

An economic bubble is a situation in which asset prices are much higher than the underlying fundamentals can reasonably justify. Bubbles are sometimes caused by unlikely and overly optimistic projections about the future. They could also be described as prices which strongly exceed the asset's intrinsic value.

Now, there is no widely accepted theory to explain their occurrence.

Recent computer-generated agency models suggest excessive leverage could be a key factor in causing financial bubbles.[





## Fiscal Policy

Fiscal policy is the use of government spending and taxation to influence the economy. Governments typically use fiscal policy to promote strong and sustainable growth and reduce poverty. 

The logic behind this approach is that when people pay lower taxes, they have more money to spend or invest, which fuels higher demand. That demand leads firms to hire more, decreasing unemployment, and causing fierce competition for labor. In turn, this serves to raise wages and provide consumers with more income to spend and invest. It's a virtuous cycle. or positive feedback loop. 

Rather than lowering taxes, the government may seek economic expansion through increases in spending (without corresponding tax increases). Building more highways, for example, could increase employment, pushing up demand and growth.

Expansionary fiscal policy is usually characterized by deficit spending, when government expenditures exceed receipts from taxes and other sources. In practice, deficit spending tends to result from a combination of tax cuts and higher spending.







# Statistics 

## Measures of central tendency

### Mean

The mean is usually referred to as 'the average'.

Calculating the population mean ($$ \mu $$) is done with this formula:
$$
\displaystyle  \mu = \frac{\sum x_{i}}{n}
$$
Calculating the sample mean ($$ \bar{x} $$) is done with this formula:
$$
\displaystyle \bar{x} = \frac{\sum x_{i}}{n}
$$

```python
import numpy

values = [4,11,7,14]

x = numpy.mean(values)

print(x)
```





### Median

The median is the middle value in a data set ordered from low to high.



```python
import numpy

values = [13,21,21,40,42,48,55,72]

x = numpy.median(values)

print(x)
```





### Mode

The mode is the value(s) that are the most common in the data.



```python
from statistics import multimode

values = [4,7,3,8,11,7,10,19,6,9,12,12]

x = multimode(values)

print(x)
```







## Measures of variability

### Range

The range is the difference between the smallest and the largest value of the data.





### Quartiles

Quartiles are values that separate the data into four equal parts.

- Q0 is the smallest value in the data.
- Q1 is the value separating the first quarter from the second quarter of the data.
- Q2 is the middle value (median), separating the bottom from the top half.
- Q3 is the value separating the third quarter from the fourth quarter
- Q4 is the largest value in the data.

```python
import numpy

values = [13,21,21,40,42,48,55,72]

x = numpy.quantile(values, [0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1])

print(x)
```



### Percentiles

Percentiles are values that separate the data into 100 equal parts.

For example, The 95th percentile separates the lowest 95% of the values from the top 5%



```python
import numpy

values = [13,21,21,40,42,48,55,72]

x = numpy.percentile(values, 65)

print(x)
```





### Interquartile Range

Interquartile range is the difference between the first and third quartiles (Q1 and Q3).

IQR = Q3 − Q1



```python
from scipy import stats

values = [13,21,21,40,42,48,55,72]

x = stats.iqr(values)

print(x)
```





### Standard Deviation

Calculating the standard deviation ($$ \mu $$) is done with this formula:
$$
\displaystyle  \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_{i}-\mu)^2}{n}}
$$
Calculating the sample standard deviation ($$ s $$) is done with this formula:
$$
\displaystyle s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_{i}-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}
$$

```python
import numpy

values = [4,11,7,14]

x = numpy.std(values)

print(x)
```







## Distribution

### Normal Distribution

The normal distribution is described by the mean ($$ \mu $$) and the standard deviation ($$ \sigma $$).

<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/statistics/img_normal_distribution.svg" alt="Normal Distributions with indicated probabilities." style="zoom: 67%;" />

- Roughly 68.3% of the data is within 1 standard deviation of the average (from μ-1σ to μ+1σ)
- Roughly 95.5% of the data is within 2 standard deviations of the average (from μ-2σ to μ+2σ)
- Roughly 99.7% of the data is within 3 standard deviations of the average (from μ-3σ to μ+3σ)





### Standard Normal Distribution

The standard normal distribution, also called the z-distribution, is a special normal distribution where the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1.

Any normal distribution can be standardized by converting its values into z-scores. Z-scores tell you how many standard deviations from the mean each value lies.









### T Distribution

The t-distribution is a type of normal distribution that is used for smaller sample sizes. Normally-distributed data form a bell shape when plotted on a graph, with more observations near the mean and fewer observations in the tails.

The t-distribution is used when data are approximately normally distributed, which means the data follow a bell shape but the population variance is unknown. The variance in a t-distribution is estimated based on the degrees of freedom of the data set (total number of observations minus 1).

If you measure the average test score from a sample of only 20 students, you should use the t-distribution to estimate the confidence interval around the mean. If you use the z-distribution, your confidence interval will be artificially precise.





### Confidence Intervals

The confidence interval is defined by a lower bound and an upper bound.

This gives us a range of values that the true parameter is likely to be between.
